>  **note:** make sure to run the container on the latest L4T host system (r32.7.1). Running on older JetPack releases (e.g. r32.6.1) can cause driver issues, since L4T drivers are passed into the container.

## If an image with your desired python version doesn't exist in the docker hub, or you are running an older jetpack release, or you are running a different board (e.g. AGX/NX Xavier), then you'll need to build it manually
